                testing equipment like power meters and Ohmmeters. Even in the late 1940s the
                electronics testing and measuring industry was relatively young, as measurement
                standards and truly reliable tube-type and electromechanical instruments had been
                introduced around the turn of the century. A highly accurate Ohmmeter 
                (used to measure electrical resistance in a circuit), for example, was among the
                first of the new generation of testing equipment developed in the early 1900s. 
                It was followed by more accurate power meters (for measuring voltage),
                ammeters (used to measure current), and other apparatus.<br />
